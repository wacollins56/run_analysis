### Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data module

This repository contains my work relatd to the course project.

The raw data consists of training and test data sets - x, y, and subject.

The script merges the training and test data sets.
After merging the data, labels are added and then only the columns pertaining to mean and standard deviation are kept.

The script then creates a tidy data set.
